# Project 10: Object-Oriented Programming Challenge

## Team Profile Generator

## Description
This project is a Node.js command-line application that generates a team profile. It allows users to enter the general information about their employees of a software engineering team. The application would then take the input to generate an HTML page that displays a summary of each team member.

The HTML output can be viewed at this [link](https://kikigoestech.github.io/team-profile-generator/dist/index.html). Click [here](/../main/dist/index.html) to view the `index.html` file.

## Installation
1. To install this application, `git clone` this repository, or download the `.zip` file in the dropdown after clicking the green ‘Code’ button at the top of this repository—as long as it is in your local branch.
2. Ensure Node.js is installed.
3. Using the code editor of your choice, you need to install [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) node package by entering the following in the command line of terminal:
```
npm inquirer
```
4. In addition to **Inquirer.js**, you must install [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) node package to run specific tests:
```
npm i jest
```

## Usage
Ensure that you are in the root directory in order for this application to run successfully. This application will initialize by running this command line in terminal:
```
node index.js
```
The **Inquirer** package for Node.js collects input regarding your team within the command line. Enter the employee's information as prompted, and it will organize that info & display it on an HTML page.

The newly-generated `index.html` file will be found in the `dist` folder that goes hand-in-hand with the `style.css` file already present there.
